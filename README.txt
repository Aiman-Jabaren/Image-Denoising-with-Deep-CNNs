This project has been implemented as an assignment for ML for Image Processing course

We will be using deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with PyTorch, investigate DnCNN and U-net architectures.
We will be using images from the \Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark" that are down-
loadable here https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/

We will be investigating different architictures:
DnCNN
U-net like CNN
U-net like CNNs with dilated convolutions
